Adding the steps that are used to manually trigger the build/deploy when changes are made

1. Rebuild docker image:
    a) docker build -t dockerid/imagename .
    b) docker push dockerid/imagename

2. Build the deployment (if it doesnt exist)
    Ensure that the .yaml file looks for the latest version 
    a) kubectl apply -f depl-file.yaml

3. If the deployment is already running
    a) kubectl rollout restart deployment depl-name
